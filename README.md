# Tribute Page

For this exercise we will make a tribute page similar to [this example](https://digitalcareerinstitute.github.io/UIB-box-model-tribute-page/).

## Setup
- for your project create an `index.html` and a `style.css` file in the root of the project folder

## Specifications

- include an image

- include a list, ordered or unordered

- there should be at least one link

- use **semantic HTML** - `header`, `main`, `footer` etc.

- style the page to the best of your abilities

- make sure to properly use `padding`, `margin`, `width` and `height`

- be creative!

## Bonus

Publish your page on GitHub pages to share with everyone

Good luck and have fun!
